While we are all still primarily stuck at home, this is the perfect time for parents to work with their young kids to do something beneficial to help shape their future.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Covid-19 inspired LWE to also produce The Rainbow Race into a tangible course a child can take with a parent at home. It comprises of the 7 books and discussion pages. These 2 activities are the main features of this product that enlighten children with positive awareness. This can also be a fun Christmas gift to spend quality time with a child. It has the same concept as The Rainbow Race App except it will also contain a “Certificate of Completion” personally and authentically signed by the author Stella Gain. The first 1000 copies of this course will be available at our on-line store. Keep checking.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">LWE Inc. agrees with child experts that if children under 7 years old were made to feel “noticed” and “valuable” at this precious time in their young lives, our future world would be a safer and more loving place to live. Please see <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"###\">“Endorsements.”</a></span></h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">For the price of a fast food meal for two or even two lattes, an adult can spend hours of quality time with their young child while helping them to experience the entertaining, but constructive Rainbow Race; a race that can help guide young lives down the best road in order to be rewarded with good health and success!</h4>\r\n<h5 class=\"text-h4\">In the mean time, hunger impacts one out of every nine people on earth, and one in four of the world’s children are stunted due to malnutrition.

We must all find a way to help these innocent children.</h5>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">LWE Inc. hopes to be a force of the future along with “Feeding the Children.” It IS possible and it starts with us.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Enjoy this race because on the other side of the rainbow there is a possible golden existence for everyone!</h4>'),

She realized that entertaining kids (with a purpose) helps with their healthy mental and emotional development. After observing and being around many children, she focused on some of the trying times that almost all children will face during childhood.

Having a child and researching children’s needs led her to discover that the most important time of mental and emotional development for a human being is from the ages of 0-7 years old. Accordingly, whatever a child experiences in these early years, shapes that child into who they will be as an adult. Eventually, she put her studies and ideas together and designed The Rainbow Race. She realized that entertaining kids (with a purpose) helps with their healthy mental and emotional development. After observing and being around many children, she focused on some of the trying times that almost all children will face during childhood. To help build her vision, Stella contacted associates who believed in her work. Hence, The Rainbow Race was produced by a group of generous and talented people, who unconditionally used their skills to help entertain and benefit little children.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-4 text-h4\">Children are the future of the world!

Having a child and researching children’s needs led her to discover that the most important time of mental and emotional development for a human being is from the ages of 0-7 years old. Accordingly, whatever a child experiences in these early years, shapes that child into who they will be as an adult. Eventually, she put her studies and ideas together and designed The Rainbow Race. She realized that entertaining kids (with a purpose) helps with their healthy mental and emotional development. After observing and being around many children, she focused on some of the trying times that almost all children will face during childhood. To help build her vision, Stella contacted associates who believed in her work. Hence, The Rainbow Race was produced by a group of generous and talented people, who unconditionally used their skills to help entertain and benefit little children.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-4 text-h4\">Children are the future of the world!

This special package can be a great gift for a kid! <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"##\">See Endorsements</a></span></h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Our next goal is to manufacture hardcover books of The Rainbow Race. Sadly, the art of reading actual books seems to be dying out, even for young children. We still believe tangible books are more indelible upon the strong and healthy development of very young children. This should never be forgotten in this computer age.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Our Rainbow Race online store will soon be selling apparel and school items that will continue the themes and personalities of The Rainbow Race stories. Check back often!</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Our ambition for the future is to update The Rainbow Race app with additional sophisticated games and animation, etc. We appear to do this every 7 years, as this version of The Rainbow Race is not our first.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">One of our many goals is to donate to less fortunate children and their myriad causes including feeding the children, children’s homes, foster home organizations, etc. We appreciate your support with this by using word of mouth to spread our important cause the <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"###\"><b>I CHOOSE LOVE campaign.</b></a></span></h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Our first goal at hand is “Feeding the Children.” In fact our dream is to feed as many children as possible with not only nutrition but much-needed awareness too…. making the future world a much better place to live in.</h4>'),

Karaoke is a fun way to motivate a child to listen and remember in order to be focused and independent for future learning. A child can learn to read in a speedy fashion, helping them to be alert and full of energy. Karaoke can be a project for an adult and their child to play together. Get your singing skills ready!

The stories encourage a child to choose the right way to handle a trying situation, when it comes up. These realistic stories actually happen to a lot of young children unbeknownst to parents at times. It is helpful to a child, at a young age, to know that most of them can choose their reactions to negative situations and that positive emotions can overcome negative ones. These stories can help parents and guardians to bring important awareness to their children in a fun, but constructive way.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"##\"> THE RAINBOW RACE (course)</a></span> is sold separate from the The Rainbow Race app. The course contains the 7 storybooks, their discussion pages, and its “Certificate of Completion” that is the reward for finishing the race. The Certificate of Completion will be available at the back of the 7th book. It is authentically signed by the author, Stella Gain and has a space for a child’s name and another adult’s signature, as a way to show a child that their accomplishment of finishing the 7 books (or the race) was important and is now official. This certificate also has words of affirmation on it, and can be a reminder to stay positive no matter what, which is its message. It is beneficial to a child to either frame this certificate or simply place it in a place where a child can be reminded to make positive choices. <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"###\">Check out The Rainbow Race Store.</a></span></h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"##\">THE CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION:</a></span> is a certificate given to a child at the end of the 7th book as a reward for finishing the race. At the end of each book there will be a code that an adult can input on the <a class=\"text-change\" href=\"###\">Record Your Child’s Progress</a> page (See the certificates at the bottom of this page) in order a keep a record of which level their child has reached. When all 7 codes have been recorded, an adult can download this certificate from the same page. The Certificate of Completion consists of affirmations such as: “I Choose to be a Winner!” “I Choose to be Happy!” or “I Choose Love! The adult can choose a certificate from these three affirmations; whichever certificate is appropriate for their child. The author, Stella Gain, has already signed it. It has a space for the child’s name and a space for a parent/guardian to also sign it as way to make it official for the child. This will make the child feel like they truly accomplished a beneficial goal. LWE Inc. recommends that a child display this certificate in their room in order to remind them to acknowledge or speak these words into their life on a regular basis, and even through troubling times. Words of affirmation have been proven to help a person stay positive and successful. <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"###\">\"See Affirmations\"</a></span></h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"#\">THE DISCUSSION PAGES:</a></span> After reading each story, a discussion page is available for an adult and child to spend more quality time together. This page includes questions about the story and can help the child to further understand the message. There are also a few new words to learn. A valuable conversation can happen about the importance of these new words that appear in each story. A child can learn and understand important words in a fun way that will also help them to live a successful life.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"#\">THE RAINBOW RACE</a></span> (course) is sold separate from the app and contains the storybooks, their discussion pages, and its “Certificate of Completion” that is the reward for finishing the race.

These games can be a bonus or an enjoyable way to help a child think and focus on a specific goal, helping them to strengthen their mental health from a young age. The games can help with utilizing their memory and brain muscles, which will help speed up the development of a young child’s mind, by keeping them occupied as they achieve. These constructive games encourage a child to keep going in order to finish the specific goals of the games.</h5>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\"><span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"#\">THE RAINBOW RACE SONGS:</a></span> At the end of each book, and once it is completed there is a bonus song available that interprets the story in song form. A child can dance and sing along to the catchy choruses sung by children their own age, who are there to help them relate to the messages. Music and singing are proven tools to help a child’s brain develop at a rapid pace…these songs are bouncy and up-tempo for this very reason. These songs will help older children to memorize their words in order to perform the karaoke versions, if they wish.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"#\">KARAOKE:</a></span> After listening to the songs, older children may want to perform one of the songs themselves. These karaoke tracks are instrumentals and are available for a child to sing along to their favorite song, while boosting their confidence for the next stages of their life. These instrumental tracks have been slowed down in order for a child to keep up. Karaoke is a fun way to motivate a child to listen and remember in order to be focused and independent for future learning. A child can learn to read in a speedy fashion, helping them to be alert and full of energy. Karaoke can be a project for an adult and their child to play together. Get your singing skills ready! The instrumental tracks can also be an addition to a new baby’s healthy development. The karaoke tracks have beats and instruments that can stimulate a baby’s brain and development.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"#\">NAP TIME:</a></span> The author Stella Gain narrates each story in order for a child to listen to while they fall sleep. The stories repeat with Stella’s soothing voice helping a child to contentedly fall asleep. From a baby to a toddler these bedtime stories can help a child’s brain to develop proficiently, while they nap. Listening to readings and music are well known activities that help a baby/infant develop the muscles in their brain that they will need to use later to perfect the skills they choose. This feature can be reached any time and is not part of the actual Rainbow Race. We also recommend playing the karaoke tracks to babies and toddlers while they rest. The music on these empty tracks will stimulate their brains to be active and strong.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">A percentage of The Rainbow Race funds will go toward children’s charities, where every penny counts to help less fortunate children to survive.</h4>'),

The child has completed an important task that allows them to play any game or song they wish, whenever they want to for hours and hours of further entertainment.

For instance, the games can help train the child to finish a project to the end. Most of the games will let a child know when they have achieved the goal of the game and that they should keep on going until they reach it. The song and karaoke – can be added activities to play before moving on, also. Of course, the adult can decide according to their child’s age and abilities. For example, it is recommended that older children take part in all the activities and bonuses that correspond to each book before moving on to the next book and so on.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 Once all the books are read and the race is over, a child is able to go anywhere on the app. They can play the games alone or with their friends over and over. Also, once the race is over the first time, the songs will be on play-all mode for a child to consecutively listen to all 7 songs, while doing chores or instead of watching TV. The karaoke tracks are a great way for an older child to build confidence or to learn how to perform in front of a crowd. A shy child will loosen up once a parent helps them to be comfortable with this activity.

The games are fun when they are looking for something to do or maybe even when they want to compete with a friend. The Rainbow Race can continue over and over again until the child reaches the age of approximately 7 years old – again, depending on the child.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 BTW: “Naptime” is a feature that is not part of the race mainly because it was created for babies and the first years of a child’s life. It is a feature where the author reads the 7 Rainbow Race stories in a soothing tone with the intention of lulling a baby or preschooler to sleep. The stories will repeat until a parent chooses to turn it off. Parents need a break sometimes! Therefore, “Naptime” can be played any time when needed. Babies need to be stimulated while they sleep and rest. Listening to all types of music and different readings will exercise the growing neurons in their brains and will empower their brain development. The karaoke tracks “play all” can help this endeavor with its upbeat music, which can strengthen the development of a baby’s mind, while they nap/rest. <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"##\">See Parent Info</a></span>\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 Please send your review and any ideas to <span class=\"text-email\"><a href=\"###\">contact@TheRainbowRace.com</a></span>\r\n                            </h4>'),

For instance, the games can help train the child to finish a project to the end. Most of the games will let a child know when they have achieved the goal of the game and that they should keep on going until they reach it. The song and karaoke – can be added activities to play before moving on, also. Of course, the adult can decide according to their child’s age and abilities. For example, it is recommended that older children take part in all the activities and bonuses that correspond to each book before moving on to the next book and so on.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 Once all the books are read and the race is over, a child is able to go anywhere on the app. They can play the games alone or with their friends over and over. Also, once the race is over the first time, the songs will be on play-all mode for a child to consecutively listen to all 7 songs, while doing chores or instead of watching TV. The karaoke tracks are a great way for an older child to build confidence or to learn how to perform in front of a crowd. A shy child will loosen up once a parent helps them to be comfortable with this activity. The games and karaoke are also a great ways for a child to strengthen their memory and they help a child to focus from a young age!\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 The karaoke tracks will also be on “play all’ mode and are a great way to entertain babies and toddlers while the rest or play.

The games are fun when they are looking for something to do or maybe even when they want to compete with a friend. The Rainbow Race can continue over and over again until the child reaches the age of approximately 7 years old – again, depending on the child.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 BTW: “Naptime” is a feature that is not part of the race mainly because it was created for babies and the first years of a child’s life. It is a feature where the author reads the 7 Rainbow Race stories in a soothing tone with the intention of lulling a baby or preschooler to sleep. The stories will repeat until a parent chooses to turn it off. Parents need a break sometimes! Therefore, “Naptime” can be played any time when needed. Babies need to be stimulated while they sleep and rest. Listening to all types of music and different readings will exercise the growing neurons in their brains and will empower their brain development. The karaoke tracks “play all” can help this endeavor with its upbeat music, which can strengthen the development of a baby’s mind, while they nap/rest. <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"##\">See Parent Info</a></span>\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 Please send your review and any ideas to <span class=\"text-email\"><a href=\"###\">contact@TheRainbowRace.com</a></span>\r\n                            </h4>'),

The relay race keeps going until a child reads all 7 books.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                              The main features in The Rainbow Race are the 7 inspiring storybooks, their discussion pages and its “Certificate of Completion.” The other fun features are the bonuses that compliment each book, i.e. songs, games and karaoke tracks.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                              The Rainbow Race (course) is sold separate from the app and contains the storybooks, their discussion pages, and its “Certificate of Completion” that is the reward for finishing the race. This certificate is authentically signed by the author, Stella Gain and has a space for a child’s name and another adult’s signature, as a way to show a child that their accomplishment of finishing the 7 books (or the race) was important and is now official. This certificate also has words of affirmation on it, and can be a reminder to stay positive no matter what, which is its message.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                              The differences between the course and the app are that the bonuses are not included in the course, and with the app the Certificate of Completion is downloaded here at the site instead. The course is aimed toward children who are 2 to 7 years old, whereas the app covers all ages between 0 to 7 years old. In the course the storybooks are tangible with a child being able to turn the pages alongside an adult. This makes spending quality time a richer bonding experience that can be invaluable toward a young child’s successful development. The certificate has an authentic author’s signature, and the course’s package is sold in our <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"###\">on-line store</a></span>, here at the site.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h5 class=\"text-head\">\r\n                                 The Rainbow Race app:\r\n                            </h5>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">\r\n                                 It is recommended that when a child enters the race for the first time, an adult should help them through it. The race starts with the child reading the first book, Book 1. At the end of the book a discussion page about the story shows up. An adult is advised to discuss this page with their child. This will impart more awareness on the particular subject of the book and is also a great way to spend memorable quality time with a little one.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 To keep the child enthused to stay in the race, bonus features that correspond with that book, i.e. the game, the song, and karaoke will unlock. An adult can influence the child to discuss the book with the promise that once they finish; bonuses will be given to them. The games can be played alone or with a friend. The song and karaoke offer more ways for an adult to spend quality time with a child, dancing, singing or building confidence etc. These bonuses give the child something more to look forward to! They also contribute to the child’s healthy development and self-esteem.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 Once Book 1 is read, the child will observe the lead character painting the color of their book on a rainbow that is on a scroll. In Book 1’s case it will be the color: yellow. Next, the lead character will roll up the scroll and hand it to the next lead character in the next book, Book 2, and so on, similar to a live relay race. The bonuses for each book unlock every time a book is read, and can be played at the discretion of an adult. This goes on through Book 7. When all the colors of the rainbow are filled in on the scroll, the race is over. The lead character of Book 7 then rolls up the scroll and simulates handing it to the child who has been reading the stories. This scroll represents the Certificate of Completion that has <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"##\">words of affirmation</a></span> written on it. This scroll is a reward for the child finishing the race.\r\n                            </h4>\r\n                            <h4 class=\"text-h4\">\r\n                                 When the child reads each book a code pops up. An adult must record this code on the <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"##\">Record Your Child’s Progress</a></span> page here at the site. Once all 7 codes have been recorded the adult confirms that the child has finished the race, which will enable them to download the Certificate of Completion. This is an important reward for the child. The author Stella Gain has already signed this certificate. It has a place for the child’s name and a place for the parent/guardian to sign. This will make it official for all involved and is an accomplishment that will not be forgotten, hopefully lasting a lifetime. The child has completed an important task that allows them to play any game or song they wish, whenever they want to for hours and hours of further entertainment.

Each book can be read over and over, especially when a child is experiencing a trying situation.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 1/Yellow: Four Yummy Cupcakes</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">This book encourages young children to choose to eat healthy. For example, if they eat cupcakes or candy, this book will help them to remember to eat in moderation. It encourages a child to share and to be fair, when making decisions. A parent/guardian can further explain to their child with its discussion page that staying fit and healthy includes exercise, as well as eating more fruits and vegetables. This book supports the “Let’s Move” campaign that educates children to learn these facts from a young age in order for them to live healthy and successful lives in the future.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 2/Pink: Honest Little Me</h4>\r\n<h5 class=\"text-h4 padding\">This story motivates young children to choose to be honest. Although, to a young child it might seem easier to be dishonest, this book demonstrates to them that being honest is the best way to go. It explains that the consequences of being dishonest are far more daunting and lead to more troubles than they will be able to handle. Book 2 expresses to a child that being trusted is gratifying and will bring them happiness. A parent can further explain to a child with its discussion page that being trustworthy is important and that accountability is a much-needed quality that will help lead them to success.</h5>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 3/Orange: If I Work Very Hard</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">This book encourages young children to choose to practice and work hard in every activity they take part in. Most children finally choose the activities that they are interested in, or have a certain talent for. Therefore, leading up to these important choices, they need to try every accessible activity in order to rightly distinguish where their talent lies. Then, if they work hard and practice their chosen activity, they will eventually be great at it. A child’s talent (academically or athletically) that is discovered in their younger years can lead to a scholarship or even a lucrative career. Even though most kids will take their whole childhood to figure out their career, learning these principles from a young age (in a fun and exciting way) can empower them to achieve their goals later on. Book 3’s goal with an adult’s help is to enlighten a child that not everyone can be #1, however, doing their very best will automatically make them #1 on their own personal list. Websites and social media that are now a big part of a child’s life have lists, rankings and reviews galore. Therefore a young child needs to be equipped with the confidence and knowledge of who they are in order for them to overcome the huge pressures they will eventually feel from these unavoidable outside forces.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 4/Green: The Green Eyed Monster</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">This book enlightens a child that sometimes they may sense uncomfortable feelings of envy or jealousy while observing another’s possessions or success. This story will help them to understand that this might be a reason they feel angry or lash out at a friend. The Green Eyed Monster encourages children to acknowledge that they need to be accountable for their negative actions instead of shifting the blame onto others. In a touching way, this book will demonstrate the negative consequences of not managing these emotions and will show them how to change them for their good. Young children do not have the experience to know this important information and sadly, once they are a fully developed these negative feelings are difficult to change or manage as adults. Therefore, young children need to be educated about this approach during their younger years in order to help them build successful lives and lasting relationships… that keep envy/jealousy out.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 5/Red: My Baby Sister</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">This book explains to a child that anger is not an acceptable way to react to their frustrations or annoyances. It demonstrates a safer and more suitable way to handle this highly negative and even dangerous feeling. It shows how they can choose self-control, which is a much better choice to achieve their wants and needs. They will also learn with its discussion page that revenge is not an acceptable response. Anger is an extremely strong emotion that needs to be eliminated and dealt with before the age of 7 years old or it can lead to angry, bitter, and vengeful adults.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 6/Blue: The Blue Ranger</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">This book tackles the feeling a child can get when they desperately want an item/toy that does not belong to them. It discourages the thought and possible action of taking the item without permission. A parent with its discussion page can teach their child to choose to ask permission or work hard to obtain the item instead. Small or fun chores can be an effective way to communicate to a child that they can work for the things they want.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 7/Purple: If You Want to be a Winner!</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">The 7th book of The Rainbow Race has several life lessons. It inspires a child to be considerate to other people. It demonstrates that there is no need to boast or bully others in order to be noticed or get ahead. It shows that a hard life or setbacks cannot stop a person from being successful if they set their mind to it. It encourages a child to keep on going and to never stop until their dream has been achieved. Its discussion page delves further into these issues and with a parent’s help a child will be able to keep going no matter whatever obstacle comes their way.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">FYI: A code will pop up at the end of each book. This code can be recorded on the <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"mylevel.html\">Records Your Child’s Progress</a></span> page here at the site.. Once all 7 codes have been recorded, an adult can download a choice of a FREE Certificate of Completion.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">See the \"Certificates of Completion\" at the bottom of the <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"mylevel.html\">Records Your Child’s Progress</a></span> Page.</h4>'),

A parent/guardian can further explain to their child with its discussion page that staying fit and healthy includes exercise, as well as eating more fruits and vegetables.

It explains that the consequences of being dishonest are far more daunting and lead to more troubles than they will be able to handle. Book 2 expresses to a child that being trusted is gratifying and will bring them happiness. A parent can further explain to a child with its discussion page that being trustworthy is important and that accountability is a much-needed quality that will help lead them to success.</h5>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 3/Orange: If I Work Very Hard</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">This book encourages young children to choose to practice and work hard in every activity they take part in. Most children finally choose the activities that they are interested in, or have a certain talent for. Therefore, leading up to these important choices, they need to try every accessible activity in order to rightly distinguish where their talent lies. Then, if they work hard and practice their chosen activity, they will eventually be great at it. A child’s talent (academically or athletically) that is discovered in their younger years can lead to a scholarship or even a lucrative career. Even though most kids will take their whole childhood to figure out their career, learning these principles from a young age (in a fun and exciting way) can empower them to achieve their goals later on. Book 3’s goal with an adult’s help is to enlighten a child that not everyone can be #1, however, doing their very best will automatically make them #1 on their own personal list.

This story will help them to understand that this might be a reason they feel angry or lash out at a friend. The Green Eyed Monster encourages children to acknowledge that they need to be accountable for their negative actions instead of shifting the blame onto others. In a touching way, this book will demonstrate the negative consequences of not managing these emotions and will show them how to change them for their good. Young children do not have the experience to know this important information and sadly, once they are a fully developed these negative feelings are difficult to change or manage as adults. Therefore, young children need to be educated about this approach during their younger years in order to help them build successful lives and lasting relationships… that keep envy/jealousy out.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 5/Red: My Baby Sister</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">This book explains to a child that anger is not an acceptable way to react to their frustrations or annoyances. It demonstrates a safer and more suitable way to handle this highly negative and even dangerous feeling. It shows how they can choose self-control, which is a much better choice to achieve their wants and needs. They will also learn with its discussion page that revenge is not an acceptable response. Anger is an extremely strong emotion that needs to be eliminated and dealt with before the age of 7 years old or it can lead to angry, bitter, and vengeful adults.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"book-heading\">Book 6/Blue: The Blue Ranger</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4 padding\">This book tackles the feeling a child can get when they desperately want an item/toy that does not belong to them.

This was proven when Covid-19 unexpectedly and ferociously attacked the world. A myriad of children from different countries all around the world spontaneously began painting rainbows to symbolize their love and courage even in difficult times. These pretty rainbow paintings and drawings, big and small were everywhere. They were in people’s windows, on the streets, pinned on trees and stuck on cars. There were games invented including “The Rainbow Hunt” where kids had to find these rainbows on other people’s windows, while still social distancing etc. There were several rainbow groups formed, some with kids who painted rainbows to thank the essential workers and to give them hope. These innate actions of our little children showed that they had the foresight to stay positive no matter what, and this was their choice. They chose the rainbow to express and represent their thoughts and feelings during dark times. The Rainbow Race’s products aim to shine a light on our little children\'s need for a happy, healthy and successful future world.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Did you know that it has been confirmed by almost every top child expert that whatever a child experiences between the ages of 0 - 5 years old, will contribute to almost ALL of who they will be as an adult? Therefore, as each valuable year goes by after this age, it will take a lot of hard work to manage poor behavior habits, hurtful emotions or uncontrolled anger that may have developed throughout that time. Fortunately, if a very young child has suffered damage because they were placed in harmful situations or they lacked the proper attention, the mentioned negative outcomes can be counteracted… <i>if dealt with during this very short time</i>. We say, “Very short time” because we want to hit home that before you know it those first 5-7 years of a child will be over. There will be nothing we can do to turn back the hands of time, if we neglected certain necessities that our children needed to live successful lives in the future. If you know this already you will be ahead of the game, but we hope this campaign can be a constant reminder …especially if you are thinking about starting a new family. If you have family members or friends, who already have young children or who are beginning a new family, pass this important information onto them. It will help to make the world a safer and better place in the future. Every helping hand given towards this cause can help to make a lasting difference.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">If this information is fairly new to you, then this campaign’s hope is to enlighten you with this valuable awareness in order to help bring love and success to as many people as possible. This knowledge needs to be widely spread in order to bring more LOVE instead of more hate into the world. It is especially beneficial to young adults who are entering the chaotic adult world of today.</h4>\r\n<h5 class=\"text-h4\">Child psychologists and neurobiologists, who have studied young children and their mental and emotional health for many years, have established significant facts about our kids. As caring and concerned researchers of this subject, Love Wins Every-time Inc. (LWE) wishes to relay this information to you. We have also confirmed these findings with the experts on our <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"endorsements.html\">“Endorsements”</a></span> page in order to pass on this vital awareness to you in a nutshell. This will save people valuable time and will help to equip them with life changing knowledge before it is too late. The web and word of mouth are the best and most efficient forms of spreading awareness. In this somewhat microwave world, most of us simply do not have the time to do our own research unless we really need to…. but once again, by then it might be too late. Reading the rest of this page will only take about 10 minutes of your time, but in light of the suffering that is happening all around us, it will truly be worth it.</h5>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">It is recommended that when a child enters the race for the first time, an adult should help them through it. The race starts with the child reading the first book, Book 1. At the end of the book a discussion page about the story shows up. An adult is advised to discuss this page with their child. This will impart more awareness on the particular subject of the book and is also a great way to spend memorable quality time with a little one.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">90% of the human brain develops by the age of 5 years old (give or take a year or two and depending on the child) which almost always means it has become 90% developed and fixed with whatever has been experienced during this time. Consequently, fun, motivating, and quality times with a child before the ages of 5 -7 years old can offset harmful experiences and still produce a successful adult who is confident and secure with who they are. On the other hand, if troublesome issues are not tackled early on in life, they will almost definitely lead to insecurities, uncontrolled emotions, negative traits, and destructive behaviors in adulthood. Broken relationships, wrong choices, depression and drug addictions are also primarily the result of unresolved issues from early childhood. The first years of a person’s life fly by and in this busy and uncertain world, this much-needed awareness for parents/guardians and young children is what inspired the <i>I Choose Love campaign.</i></h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">LWE created <i>“The Rainbow Race”</i> app, a fun and multifaceted app that is comprised of 7 entertaining stories, catchy songs, brain teasing games, confidence building karaoke tracks, calming naptime readings, and more. In fact all of its features attempt to enlighten young children on how they can choose positive ways over negative ones, in numerous fun ways. The Rainbow Race’s contribution to this cause is the hope that we can help empower young children with much needed cognizance and understanding, making it easier for them to handle negative situations from an early age – all while making it entertaining to learn. The Rainbow Race’s beneficial activities can help to override bad experiences that a young child may experience, enhancing their lives with the special tools they need to develop the best way they possibly can. Any help with informing young children about choosing to be positive instead of negative will help them to develop into successful and healthy adults in the future.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Positive early experiences provide the base for the brain’s organizational development and functioning throughout life. In addition, early bad experiences will also have a direct impact on how children develop learning skills as well as how they learn vital social and emotional skills. For example, when a child is born, that child has all the neurons it will ever have in its life. Neurons are the primary components of the brain and nervous system – they are the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the outside world, for sending motor commands to our brain, and transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every phase of development in-between. Moreover, the last moments of these neural connections, when they finally set will define who we are as people.</h4>\r\n<h5 class=\"text-h4\">Think of the neurons in a brain as being wires in a home instead. If certain wiring is not connected, appliances won’t work. Lights won’t turn on. The worst scenario of bad wiring would be zero electric power in the home at all – leaving everywhere in the home dark and scary. A candle can help, but it cannot fix or get rid of the problem altogether. The wiring has to be repaired so that the electric in the household can work correctly. Similarly, research has shown that if a baby is not touched by loving hands or gentle voices on a regular basis (not relaying the needed electrical signals for their brain to develop properly), then certain wiring in their brain simply cannot and will not connect. Furthermore, and adding to the urgency of connecting these wires properly early on; a baby’s brain doubles in size in the first year. Consequently, good and (unfortunately) bad experiences in a child’s first years will vastly be responsible for guiding the direction of how their brain will develop; these are the actual structural foundations of who that baby will be and how they will survive in the future.</h5>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">An electrician, who can rewire or replace inoperable wiring, is able to fix damaged electrical wiring in a home. A baby only has the neurons they were born with and if they are left damaged or improperly connected; it is only natural that certain parts of their brain will be left in the dark or undeveloped. Remember, these neurons help mature the skills, emotions and character of a person; the disconnections of a person’s wiring greatly explains why humans have certain issues in adulthood. Now we can understand that it is reasonable to say that once the neurons in a young child are set at around the age of 5 years old, they cannot be transformed or rewired any other way. After that, their brains will only have 10% left to develop before adulthood. Therapy can take the place of a candle maybe, but if we have these facts, we can do our best to avoid unnecessary pain for our kids in their future lives. It is well known that hurt people hurt other people; but if we can help eradicate this harmful cycle, we can make room for more love in this world.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">The main facts we need to keep in mind are:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>1. A baby’s brain doubles in size in its first year.</li>\r\n 	<li>2. By the age of 3 years old, a toddler’s brain has reached 80% of its adult volume.</li>\r\n 	<li>3. By the age of 5 years old, a young child’s brain has reached 90% of its adult volume.</li>\r\n 	<li>4. After the age of 5 years old, a child’s brain only has 10% left to develop by adulthood.</li>\r\n 	<li>5. A young child who has been ignored or abused, without receiving any guidance on how to cope during this time, will inevitably become an adult who lacks positive characteristics and emotions such as kindness, empathy or love for others etc. Instead, they will try to survive with the negative behaviors mentioned earlier.</li>\r\n 	<li>6. Lack of self-esteem, shyness and antisocial behaviors are more results of the absence of attention or the lack of proper nurturing activities from a very young age. The Rainbow Race’s activities can help override these negative outcomes because it focuses on children between the ages of 0-7 years old.</li>\r\n 	<li>7. If we now know that we can help prevent these detrimental behaviors from setting in a child, then why not spend our first five years with them intently focused on their wellbeing? It is a small price to pay for a better life.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">We no longer have to wonder why certain people act certain ways (apart from inherited health, genetics or their environments). Consequently, with this awareness at hand, if a person is in an abusive situation with another person, they need to consider making the difficult (and yes, it is difficult) choice to leave at the first sign of attempts of isolation or verbal and physical abuse, etc. This can also be true with friends, contacts and associates at work as well romantic relationships. Thinking that person will change or attempting to change that person while believing their apologies will be real just cannot qualify as a true recovery because now we know their brain has been set as a result of their bad experiences as a young child. Bringing new children into this unsafe environment only creates more pain and adds to a loveless world. It promotes the cycle of abuse instead eliminating it. Also, recognize that lot of these people can fake it and it will not be real; the crazy in them will most likely rear its ugly head sooner than later, and that is why their cycle of mistreatment of others will no doubt happen over and over again. However, if we can understand the future harmful results of our manipulated (by another) choices, we can now use this awareness to give us the strength to make the correct choices with confidence and without wondering, what if? Because now know, what if!</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Women and men waste many years of their lives hoping and thinking their friend or partner will change or they may think “it’s just a phase,” etc. And yes, abusive people can be fun and charming at times and that surely can fool some people but with a solid consciousness, we can now stop them in their tracks and instead choose the right path so as to achieve happy, love-filled lives with others. Once and for all, we can choose to refuse to further experience any more painful and wasted years and instead choose to save our children and ourselves.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Whatever the case may be and if we are stuck in inescapable situations, we can still help our children. The more a young child reads, listens to stories or music, or takes part in fun and motivating activities during their early years, the stronger and healthier that child’s brain will develop during any kind of journey into adulthood. It begins with babies, so parents must start right away by nurturing them with loving care and motivating activities to empower their development. One parent can achieve this for their children, even if the other parent does not have the foresight to do so. Adults who are prone to arguing, yelling or who are negatively demonstrative must do their best to take it to a different room. “Not in front of the baby/children,” is a rule that must be kept if young children are to be protected and saved from the hazards of harmful experiences. You can be the one to shield those precious neurons and keep them on the right path of development. We must be able to manage this for our children at least up to the age of 5- 7 years old because child experts have warned us what will happen to our children if we do not keep this guidance.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><i>The Rainbow Race</i> app can help an adult to encourage or guide a child to choose positive ways. A positive response or emotion can be chosen if it is learned and taught that it is possible, even at a very young age. A lot of young children are sheltered or uneducated on this subject because their parents believe it is too early. However, when tough times arrive, their children will not have the skills to know how to handle them. Consequently, once again as adults they will become disappointed and bitter, which will lead to the negative results already mentioned. It is a vicious cycle. Young children need to be made aware of these wise choices at a young age so they do not get caught in its trap.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><i>The Rainbow Race </i>helps a parent/guardian to empower a child to feel confident and full of self-worth in order for them to grow up mentally and emotionally healthy. It is up to the parent/guardian to accomplish this with their young child while that child is at the perfect age, in order for them to have a greater chance of living a loving and successful life. The Rainbow Race app is an easy and stimulating way for an adult to spend much needed quality time with their little one. This time also can create great and lasting memories and important bonds for a family.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Child experts have discovered that “valuing” a child when they are very young is a top need. Spending quality time with them can help do this. “Noticing” a child is a close second. A very young child needs to be constantly encouraged – not ignored – especially during the rough times. Quality time with a young child is everything to the success of their healthy development. Young children need affection and attention. They need to be recognized for their early achievements as much as possible. This will assist them to be able to manage long lasting relationships later on in life.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Child experts have discovered that “valuing” a child when they are very young is a top need.

There is plenty of information available. Love Wins Every-time Inc., produced The Rainbow Race app to help spread love and to further increase this important awareness for the future of the children and the world.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Spending a solid, enriching 20 minutes on The Rainbow Race activities one-on-one with a young child is far more valuable than sitting with them; watching 4 hours of TV every day. This minimal time spent with a young child will at the least help them to manage their emotions and recognize wrong choices. Nowadays adults can be very busy and as mentioned earlier, we all know that time goes by so quickly. This time can never be gotten back. The Rainbow Race can counteract this lack of time in our busy world. Just 20 minutes a day can do wonders to override or negate the effects of bad experiences for a young child in a most efficient and loving way. The Rainbow Race has discussion pages where an adult and a child can have discussions on a myriad of subjects that will inspire them to stay positive under most situations.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">If you know another parent or guardian of a very young child, spread this awareness to them through this site. Direct them to Parent Info, which will lead them to the “I Choose to Love!” campaign. Spreading knowledge of this campaign and about The Rainbow Race will give parents/guardians a captivating and entertaining tool to help them inspire their young children to live healthy and successful lives</h4>'),

This was proven when Covid-19 unexpectedly and ferociously attacked the world. A myriad of children from different countries all around the world spontaneously began painting rainbows to symbolize their love and courage even in difficult times. These pretty rainbow paintings and drawings, big and small were everywhere. They were in people’s windows, on the streets, pinned on trees and stuck on cars. There were games invented including “The Rainbow Hunt” where kids had to find these rainbows on other people’s windows, while still social distancing etc. There were several rainbow groups formed, some with kids who painted rainbows to thank the essential workers and to give them hope. These innate actions of our little children showed that they had the foresight to stay positive no matter what, and this was their choice. They chose the rainbow to express and represent their thoughts and feelings during dark times. The Rainbow Race’s products aim to shine a light on our little children\'s need for a happy, healthy and successful future world.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Did you know that it has been confirmed by almost every top child expert that whatever a child experiences between the ages of 0 - 5 years old, will contribute to almost ALL of who they will be as an adult? Therefore, as each valuable year goes by after this age, it will take a lot of hard work to manage poor behavior habits, hurtful emotions or uncontrolled anger that may have developed throughout that time. Fortunately, if a very young child has suffered damage because they were placed in harmful situations or they lacked the proper attention, the mentioned negative outcomes can be counteracted… <i>if dealt with during this very short time</i>. We say, “Very short time” because we want to hit home that before you know it those first 5-7 years of a child will be over. There will be nothing we can do to turn back the hands of time, if we neglected certain necessities that our children needed to live successful lives in the future. If you know this already you will be ahead of the game, but we hope this campaign can be a constant reminder …especially if you are thinking about starting a new family. If you have family members or friends, who already have young children or who are beginning a new family, pass this important information onto them. It will help to make the world a safer and better place in the future. Every helping hand given towards this cause can help to make a lasting difference.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">If this information is fairly new to you, then this campaign’s hope is to enlighten you with this valuable awareness in order to help bring love and success to as many people as possible. This knowledge needs to be widely spread in order to bring more LOVE instead of more hate into the world. It is especially beneficial to young adults who are entering the chaotic adult world of today.</h4>\r\n<h5 class=\"text-h4\">Child psychologists and neurobiologists, who have studied young children and their mental and emotional health for many years, have established significant facts about our kids. As caring and concerned researchers of this subject, Love Wins Every-time Inc. (LWE) wishes to relay this information to you. We have also confirmed these findings with the experts on our <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"endorsements.html\">“Endorsements”</a></span> page in order to pass on this vital awareness to you in a nutshell. This will save people valuable time and will help to equip them with life changing knowledge before it is too late. The web and word of mouth are the best and most efficient forms of spreading awareness. In this somewhat microwave world, most of us simply do not have the time to do our own research unless we really need to…. but once again, by then it might be too late. Reading the rest of this page will only take about 10 minutes of your time, but in light of the suffering that is happening all around us, it will truly be worth it.</h5>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">It is recommended that when a child enters the race for the first time, an adult should help them through it. The race starts with the child reading the first book, Book 1. At the end of the book a discussion page about the story shows up. An adult is advised to discuss this page with their child. This will impart more awareness on the particular subject of the book and is also a great way to spend memorable quality time with a little one.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">90% of the human brain develops by the age of 5 years old (give or take a year or two and depending on the child) which almost always means it has become 90% developed and fixed with whatever has been experienced during this time. Consequently, fun, motivating, and quality times with a child before the ages of 5 -7 years old can offset harmful experiences and still produce a successful adult who is confident and secure with who they are. On the other hand, if troublesome issues are not tackled early on in life, they will almost definitely lead to insecurities, uncontrolled emotions, negative traits, and destructive behaviors in adulthood. Broken relationships, wrong choices, depression and drug addictions are also primarily the result of unresolved issues from early childhood. The first years of a person’s life fly by and in this busy and uncertain world, this much-needed awareness for parents/guardians and young children is what inspired the <i>I Choose Love campaign.</i></h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">LWE created <i>“The Rainbow Race”</i> app, a fun and multifaceted app that is comprised of 7 entertaining stories, catchy songs, brain teasing games, confidence building karaoke tracks, calming naptime readings, and more. In fact all of its features attempt to enlighten young children on how they can choose positive ways over negative ones, in numerous fun ways. The Rainbow Race’s contribution to this cause is the hope that we can help empower young children with much needed cognizance and understanding, making it easier for them to handle negative situations from an early age – all while making it entertaining to learn. The Rainbow Race’s beneficial activities can help to override bad experiences that a young child may experience, enhancing their lives with the special tools they need to develop the best way they possibly can. Any help with informing young children about choosing to be positive instead of negative will help them to develop into successful and healthy adults in the future.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Positive early experiences provide the base for the brain’s organizational development and functioning throughout life. In addition, early bad experiences will also have a direct impact on how children develop learning skills as well as how they learn vital social and emotional skills. For example, when a child is born, that child has all the neurons it will ever have in its life. Neurons are the primary components of the brain and nervous system – they are the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the outside world, for sending motor commands to our brain, and transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every phase of development in-between. Moreover, the last moments of these neural connections, when they finally set will define who we are as people.</h4>\r\n<h5 class=\"text-h4\">Think of the neurons in a brain as being wires in a home instead. If certain wiring is not connected, appliances won’t work. Lights won’t turn on. The worst scenario of bad wiring would be zero electric power in the home at all – leaving everywhere in the home dark and scary. A candle can help, but it cannot fix or get rid of the problem altogether. The wiring has to be repaired so that the electric in the household can work correctly. Similarly, research has shown that if a baby is not touched by loving hands or gentle voices on a regular basis (not relaying the needed electrical signals for their brain to develop properly), then certain wiring in their brain simply cannot and will not connect. Furthermore, and adding to the urgency of connecting these wires properly early on; a baby’s brain doubles in size in the first year. Consequently, good and (unfortunately) bad experiences in a child’s first years will vastly be responsible for guiding the direction of how their brain will develop; these are the actual structural foundations of who that baby will be and how they will survive in the future.</h5>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">An electrician, who can rewire or replace inoperable wiring, is able to fix damaged electrical wiring in a home. A baby only has the neurons they were born with and if they are left damaged or improperly connected; it is only natural that certain parts of their brain will be left in the dark or undeveloped. Remember, these neurons help mature the skills, emotions and character of a person; the disconnections of a person’s wiring greatly explains why humans have certain issues in adulthood. Now we can understand that it is reasonable to say that once the neurons in a young child are set at around the age of 5 years old, they cannot be transformed or rewired any other way. After that, their brains will only have 10% left to develop before adulthood. Therapy can take the place of a candle maybe, but if we have these facts, we can do our best to avoid unnecessary pain for our kids in their future lives. It is well known that hurt people hurt other people; but if we can help eradicate this harmful cycle, we can make room for more love in this world.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">The main facts we need to keep in mind are:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>1. A baby’s brain doubles in size in its first year.</li>\r\n 	<li>2. By the age of 3 years old, a toddler’s brain has reached 80% of its adult volume.</li>\r\n 	<li>3. By the age of 5 years old, a young child’s brain has reached 90% of its adult volume.</li>\r\n 	<li>4. After the age of 5 years old, a child’s brain only has 10% left to develop by adulthood.</li>\r\n 	<li>5. A young child who has been ignored or abused, without receiving any guidance on how to cope during this time, will inevitably become an adult who lacks positive characteristics and emotions such as kindness, empathy or love for others etc. Instead, they will try to survive with the negative behaviors mentioned earlier.</li>\r\n 	<li>6. Lack of self-esteem, shyness and antisocial behaviors are more results of the absence of attention or the lack of proper nurturing activities from a very young age. The Rainbow Race’s activities can help override these negative outcomes because it focuses on children between the ages of 0-7 years old.</li>\r\n 	<li>7. If we now know that we can help prevent these detrimental behaviors from setting in a child, then why not spend our first five years with them intently focused on their wellbeing? It is a small price to pay for a better life.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">We no longer have to wonder why certain people act certain ways (apart from inherited health, genetics or their environments). Consequently, with this awareness at hand, if a person is in an abusive situation with another person, they need to consider making the difficult (and yes, it is difficult) choice to leave at the first sign of attempts of isolation or verbal and physical abuse, etc. This can also be true with friends, contacts and associates at work as well romantic relationships. Thinking that person will change or attempting to change that person while believing their apologies will be real just cannot qualify as a true recovery because now we know their brain has been set as a result of their bad experiences as a young child. Bringing new children into this unsafe environment only creates more pain and adds to a loveless world. It promotes the cycle of abuse instead eliminating it. Also, recognize that lot of these people can fake it and it will not be real; the crazy in them will most likely rear its ugly head sooner than later, and that is why their cycle of mistreatment of others will no doubt happen over and over again. However, if we can understand the future harmful results of our manipulated (by another) choices, we can now use this awareness to give us the strength to make the correct choices with confidence and without wondering, what if? Because now know, what if!</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Women and men waste many years of their lives hoping and thinking their friend or partner will change or they may think “it’s just a phase,” etc. And yes, abusive people can be fun and charming at times and that surely can fool some people but with a solid consciousness, we can now stop them in their tracks and instead choose the right path so as to achieve happy, love-filled lives with others. Once and for all, we can choose to refuse to further experience any more painful and wasted years and instead choose to save our children and ourselves.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Whatever the case may be and if we are stuck in inescapable situations, we can still help our children. The more a young child reads, listens to stories or music, or takes part in fun and motivating activities during their early years, the stronger and healthier that child’s brain will develop during any kind of journey into adulthood. It begins with babies, so parents must start right away by nurturing them with loving care and motivating activities to empower their development. One parent can achieve this for their children, even if the other parent does not have the foresight to do so. Adults who are prone to arguing, yelling or who are negatively demonstrative must do their best to take it to a different room. “Not in front of the baby/children,” is a rule that must be kept if young children are to be protected and saved from the hazards of harmful experiences. You can be the one to shield those precious neurons and keep them on the right path of development. We must be able to manage this for our children at least up to the age of 5- 7 years old because child experts have warned us what will happen to our children if we do not keep this guidance.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><i>The Rainbow Race</i> app can help an adult to encourage or guide a child to choose positive ways. A positive response or emotion can be chosen if it is learned and taught that it is possible, even at a very young age. A lot of young children are sheltered or uneducated on this subject because their parents believe it is too early. However, when tough times arrive, their children will not have the skills to know how to handle them. Consequently, once again as adults they will become disappointed and bitter, which will lead to the negative results already mentioned. It is a vicious cycle. Young children need to be made aware of these wise choices at a young age so they do not get caught in its trap.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\"><i>The Rainbow Race </i>helps a parent/guardian to empower a child to feel confident and full of self-worth in order for them to grow up mentally and emotionally healthy. It is up to the parent/guardian to accomplish this with their young child while that child is at the perfect age, in order for them to have a greater chance of living a loving and successful life. The Rainbow Race app is an easy and stimulating way for an adult to spend much needed quality time with their little one. This time also can create great and lasting memories and important bonds for a family.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Child experts have discovered that “valuing” a child when they are very young is a top need. Spending quality time with them can help do this. “Noticing” a child is a close second. A very young child needs to be constantly encouraged – not ignored – especially during the rough times. Quality time with a young child is everything to the success of their healthy development. Young children need affection and attention. They need to be recognized for their early achievements as much as possible. This will assist them to be able to manage long lasting relationships later on in life.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Child experts have discovered that “valuing” a child when they are very young is a top need.

There is plenty of information available. Love Wins Every-time Inc., produced The Rainbow Race app to help spread love and to further increase this important awareness for the future of the children and the world.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">Spending a solid, enriching 20 minutes on The Rainbow Race activities one-on-one with a young child is far more valuable than sitting with them; watching 4 hours of TV every day. This minimal time spent with a young child will at the least help them to manage their emotions and recognize wrong choices. Nowadays adults can be very busy and as mentioned earlier, we all know that time goes by so quickly. This time can never be gotten back. The Rainbow Race can counteract this lack of time in our busy world. Just 20 minutes a day can do wonders to override or negate the effects of bad experiences for a young child in a most efficient and loving way. The Rainbow Race has discussion pages where an adult and a child can have discussions on a myriad of subjects that will inspire them to stay positive under most situations.</h4>\r\n<h4 class=\"text-h4\">If you know another parent or guardian of a very young child, spread this awareness to them through this site. Direct them to Parent Info, which will lead them to the “I Choose to Love!” campaign. Spreading knowledge of this campaign and about The Rainbow Race will give parents/guardians a captivating and entertaining tool to help them inspire their young children to live healthy and successful lives</h4>'),

By his freshman year in high school, he was a top player in California and at the end of his freshman year he was #1 for his grade and position on several Maxpreps stat’s lists. Maxpreps.com is a site that records high school stats for all the sports in the America. He was actually #1 in the nation for double/doubles, field goals, free throws and others. Benjamin had a very bright future and kept exceling. Expert sport’s writers projected him to be in the Top 25 players of the class of 2020. However in his senior year, he suffered an ACL injury. It has been his positive attitude that has kept him going through this difficult injury. So far, he has kept his hope alive to keep on pursuing his goal. We are looking forward to his comeback.

There were many views and comments, which can be seen at <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"book3.html\">Book 3 reviews</a></span> here at the site or this demo can also still be found at Youtube.com. We remembered that the chorus of the song says, “Someday you’ll be number 1!” The years after The Rainbow Race songs were produced in 2008, we observed Benjamin work very hard to reach his goals. He practiced almost daily just like the song advises in order to get to the top. He enjoyed this work because this was his dream career. He was rewarded for his hard work by the results of his game, and now he will not give up until he reaches his goal of going pro. This Rainbow Race kid has proven it can be done.

The UK’s national anthem begins with “God save our gracious Queen, Long live our noble Queen. God save the Queen.” Millions who love and respect the Queen have sung this anthem for decades, and it could be said that this is one of the reasons why the Queen has lived so long, and is still working hard in her mid-nineties with no signs of stopping. Could it be that these heartfelt words of her people, sung on a daily basis, have been a huge factor in her very long life? Are these words also rubbing off onto her husband, Prince Philip, who is 99 years old this year?!

In fact, by the age of 11 years old, he was on a few US ranking lists and was actually number 1 in the nation on a couple of them. By his freshman year in high school, he was a top player in California and at the end of his freshman year he was #1 for his grade and position on several Maxpreps stat’s lists. Maxpreps.com is a site that records high school stats for all the sports in the America. He was actually #1 in the nation for double/doubles, field goals, free throws and others. Benjamin had a very bright future and kept exceling. Expert sport’s writers projected him to be in the Top 25 players of the class of 2020. However in his senior year, he suffered an ACL injury. It has been his positive attitude that has kept him going through this difficult injury. So far, he has kept his hope alive to keep on pursuing his goal. We are looking forward to his comeback.

There were many views and comments, which can be seen at <span class=\"text-change\"><a href=\"book3.html\">Book 3 reviews</a></span> here at the site or this demo can also still be found at Youtube.com. We remembered that the chorus of the song says, “Someday you’ll be number 1!” The years after The Rainbow Race songs were produced in 2008, we observed Benjamin work very hard to reach his goals. He practiced almost daily just like the song advises in order to get to the top. He enjoyed this work because this was his dream career. He was rewarded for his hard work by the results of his game, and now he will not give up until he reaches his goal of going pro. This Rainbow Race kid has proven it can be done.

This certificate is authentically signed by the author, Stella Gain and has a space for a child’s name and another adult’s signature, as a way to show a child that their accomplishment of finishing the 7 books (or the race) was important and is now official. This certificate also has words of affirmation on it, and can be a reminder to stay positive no matter what, which is its message. The course is aimed toward children who are 2 to 7 years old. In the course the storybooks are tangible with a child being able to turn the pages alongside an adult. This makes quality time a richer bonding experience that can be invaluable toward a young child’s successful development.
