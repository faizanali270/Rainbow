                              Rainbows can makes the most beautiful symbol for different causes and movements. Recently, young children have instinctively taken on the rainbow for their own cause of spreading LOVE and HOPE in troubled times. It is beneficial for young children, as they grow older to know the different interpretations of the rainbow and their meanings, in order for them to be well informed and so as not to be confused. The Rainbow Race app and course has a rainbow as its symbol, and supports our young children’s cause of encouraging positivity no matter what!

                              The SCIENTIFIC Rainbow: A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by the sun’s reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky. It takes the form of a multicolored circular arc in the sky. A typical rainbow usually happens, when the sun shines through the clouds during or at the end of a rainstorm. In a primary rainbow, there are 7 colors, where an arc shows red on the outer part, followed by orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet on the inner part. Rainbows have always been used in children’s stories and songs as a powerful sign of hope and love. The rain usually represents troubling times and the sun usually represents coming through the storm with good times ahead.

                              Covid-19 inspired LWE to create The Rainbow Race course, which is sold Kids All Around the World’s Rainbows: Kids all around the world are drawing and painting rainbows to spread hope, cheer and positivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. This project began in Italy, where kids painted rainbows and put them in their windows and on the street as a sign of hope for better times. Children could spot them and count them as a game, called “The Rainbow Hunt.” This compassionate venture has lead children to write uplifting messages on their rainbows, spreading them to other countries and bringing joy to overcome the fear and sadness of the coronavirus attack on the world. Consequently, the rainbow has become the symbol of hope for all children around the world. Some of the messages thank the essential workers who have risked their lives to save us. Other messages are: Tutta Andre Bene (Everything’s gonna be alight) “Brighter days are ahead” “After the storm comes brighter days” “Spread hope and positivity” “Ca Va Aller” (It will be fine.) Check out some of these rainbows, it will help you have a better day!

                              GOD’S Rainbow: It is apparent to a lot of people that it is God who designed the rainbow and directs them to materialize throughout the year to remind mankind of the covenant between Himself and the Human Race. These rainbows promise His peace and love to them, always. The establishment of the rainbow began after God had been warning Mankind, for a very long time, to make the right choices or their wicked ways would lead them into a dangerous world, where they could not be protected. In the end, only Noah’s family and the animals survived. After it rained for 40 days and 40 nights, God directed the sun to shine through the clouds, displaying a rainbow in the sky as a symbol of His promise that He would never let this happen to Mankind again. A rainbow in the sky is wonder, a spectacular creation of God that has a meaningful purpose for the people on earth because it represents His love and protection. Little children naturally know and feel this. In God’s rainbow there are forever 7 colors, beginning with red on the outer part of a bow/arc, followed by orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet on the inner side the bow.

                                 The LGBTQ Rainbow Flag: The original LGBTQ flag was designed in 1978. Gilbert Baker, who fashioned the flag after he felt that the gay nation needed a powerful symbol to represent their individuality and equality, created it. His flag originally comprised of 8 colored stripes, hot pink, red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, indigo and violet. Over the next two years, the flag changed, mainly because the hot pink fabric was unobtainable, or was too expensive to produce. Consequently, the hot pink stripe was dropped from the flag. Soon after, the turquoise and indigo stripes where replaced by one royal blue stripe, when organizers of the San Francisco’s Gay Freedom Day Parade wanted to split the flag in half in order to display equal stripes on both sides of the street. Consequently, the LGBTQ rainbow flag uses some of the colors in the rainbow, but not all of them and is not a typical rainbow. It is not arced and has one less color with 6 colored stripes: red on top followed underneath by orange, yellow, green, royal blue, and violet on the bottom, instead of the 7 colors that are naturally formed in an actual rainbow. The LGBTQ is one of the most colorful communities in the world, who are known for being happy no matter what. It is no wonder that some of the rainbow colors are perfect for their movement. Every color in their flag has a special meaning to them.

                                 The Rainbow Race’s Rainbow was designed by Love Wins Every-time Inc. in order to inspire young children to choose positive ways over negative ones. In the beginning of race, the top color of its rainbow’s arc is yellow followed by pink, orange, green, red, blue and purple on the inner part of the arc. Its colors seem to be out of order from a natural rainbow, but once a child finishes the course/race, The Rainbow Race’s rainbow is transformed into a natural rainbow with the color red on top of the arc followed by orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and pink on the inner part of the arc. This was purposeful; so as to represent how most of us are not fully prepared or know how to take on the world even when we grow into adults. However, when a child finishes The Rainbow Race’s relay race, its rainbow colors move into the correct order of the colors in a typical rainbow and is seen that way on its own reward of a Certificate of Completion. This represents a child now having the ability of knowing how to choose to be free of negativity with the knowledge of how to handle uncomfortable situations.

                                 The Human Race Rainbow: Since the death of George Floyd, LWE was inspired to create another kind of rainbow, (see “The Human Race”.) This rainbow represents all the varying skin colors of people all around the world. We hope to teach children that every shade of skin is beautiful. When The Rainbow Race began, we already had this idea in mind. We recognized that we could twist our use of the word “Race” and also use it for supporting all races of people. Consequently, The Rainbow Race kids and lead characters, who can be seen in our songs and books, represent every shade of skin color in the world. It is our way of enlightening every child around the world to stick together and furthermore to respect and love each other. Therefore, The Rainbow Race is a relay race in one way and a representation of all races (being one race) in another way. The treacherous murder of George Floyd is changing the world. We can all help by sincerely teaching our kids that every person of every color is worthy of living a peaceful and happy life, and we are all equal living together in this world.

                                 The Peace Rainbow Flag: represents the unification of all nations underneath one common symbol on a day called International Peace Day. This cause proposed that for one day of the year on September 21st every country should recognize peace around the world. The UN General Assembly has declared this as a day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace by observing 24 hours of non-violence and cease-fire. The most common recent design of this cause was a rainbow flag representing peace. It was first used in Italy at a peace march in 1961. This march inspired multi-colored flags to be used in demonstrations against nuclear weapons. The most common variety has seven colors purple, blue, azure, green, yellow, orange, and red—and is decorated in bold with the Italian word PACE, meaning "peace”. It became popular with the Pace da tutti i balconi ("peace from every balcony") campaign in 2002, started as a protest against the impending war in the world. This peace flag was flown from balconies in all the Italian cities, by citizens against the war. Its use spread to other countries and is now recognized every year. This flag is not to be confused with the LGBTQ flag because it has 7 colors and the LGBTQ flag has 6 colors. It is no wonder that it was Italy trying to bring peace to the world because children first began painting rainbows from this peace loving country during Covid 19.

                                 1st Rainbow Peace Flag: James William van Kirk, a Methodist minister from Youngstown, Ohio designed the first world peace flag of the Earth, using rainbow stripes, stars and a globe. In 1913 and 1929, he completed a peace tour through Europe with his flag. He traveled around the world arguing for the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God. The Universal Peace Congress eventually came to adopt Kirk's flag as its official World Peace Flag, and the American Peace Society as well as other groups subsequently adopted it. It consisted of the earth on a blue field covered with white stars; a white band crossed the globe and to the left was broken up into a spectrum representing the variations of the human race—different, but united in peace. The flag also shows 46 stars surrounding the globe and the spectrum.
