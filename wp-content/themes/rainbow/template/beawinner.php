                        The rainbow is the symbol of our innocent children's hope for a brighter future. This was proven when Covid-19 unexpectedly and ferociously attacked the world. A myriad of children from different countries all around the world spontaneously began painting rainbows to symbolize their love and courage even in difficult times. These pretty rainbow paintings and drawings, big and small were everywhere. They were in people’s windows, on the streets, pinned on trees and stuck on cars. There were games invented including “The Rainbow Hunt” where kids had to find these rainbows on other people’s windows, while still social distancing etc. There were several rainbow groups formed, some with kids who painted rainbows to thank the essential workers and to give them hope. These innate actions of our little children showed that they had the foresight to stay positive no matter what, and this was their choice. They chose the rainbow to express and represent their thoughts and feelings during dark times. The Rainbow Race’s products aim to shine a light on our little children's need for a happy, healthy and successful future world.

                        Did you know that it has been confirmed by almost every top child expert that whatever a child experiences between the ages of 0 - 5 years old, will contribute to almost ALL of who they will be as an adult? Therefore, as each valuable year goes by after this age, it will take a lot of hard work to manage poor behavior habits, hurtful emotions or uncontrolled anger that may have developed throughout that time. Fortunately, if a very young child has suffered damage because they were placed in harmful situations or they lacked the proper attention, the mentioned negative outcomes can be counteracted… <i>if dealt with during this very short time</i>. We say, “Very short time” because we want to hit home that before you know it those first 5-7 years of a child will be over. There will be nothing we can do to turn back the hands of time, if we neglected certain necessities that our children needed to live successful lives in the future. If you know this already you will be ahead of the game, but we hope this campaign can be a constant reminder …especially if you are thinking about starting a new family. If you have family members or friends, who already have young children or who are beginning a new family, pass this important information onto them. It will help to make the world a safer and better place in the future. Every helping hand given towards this cause can help to make a lasting difference.

                           Child psychologists and neurobiologists, who have studied young children and their mental and emotional health for many years, have established significant facts about our kids. As caring and concerned researchers of this subject, Love Wins Every-time Inc. (LWE) wishes to relay this information to you. We have also confirmed these findings with the experts on our <span class="text-change"><a href="<?php the_field('endorsements') ?>">“Endorsements”</a></span> page in order to pass on this vital awareness to you in a nutshell. This will save people valuable time and will help to equip them with life changing knowledge before it is too late.

                           It is recommended that when a child enters the race for the first time, an adult should help them through it. The race starts with the child reading the first book, Book 1. At the end of the book a discussion page about the story shows up. An adult is advised to discuss this page with their child. This will impart more awareness on the particular subject of the book and is also a great way to spend memorable quality time with a little one.

                           90% of the human brain develops by the age of 5 years old (give or take a year or two and depending on the child) which almost always means it has become 90% developed and fixed with whatever has been experienced during this time. Consequently, fun, motivating, and quality times with a child before the ages of 5 -7 years old can offset harmful experiences and still produce a successful adult who is confident and secure with who they are. On the other hand, if troublesome issues are not tackled early on in life, they will almost definitely lead to insecurities, uncontrolled emotions, negative traits, and destructive behaviors in adulthood. Broken relationships, wrong choices, depression and drug addictions are also primarily the result of unresolved issues from early childhood. The first years of a person’s life fly by and in this busy and uncertain world, this much-needed awareness for parents/guardians and young children is what inspired the <i>I Choose Love campaign.</i>

In fact all of its features attempt to enlighten young children on how they can choose positive ways over negative ones, in numerous fun ways. The Rainbow Race’s contribution to this cause is the hope that we can help empower young children with much needed cognizance and understanding, making it easier for them to handle negative situations from an early age – all while making it entertaining to learn. The Rainbow Race’s beneficial activities can help to override bad experiences that a young child may experience, enhancing their lives with the special tools they need to develop the best way they possibly can. Any help with informing young children about choosing to be positive instead of negative will help them to develop into successful and healthy adults in the future.

                           Positive early experiences provide the base for the brain’s organizational development and functioning throughout life. In addition, early bad experiences will also have a direct impact on how children develop learning skills as well as how they learn vital social and emotional skills. For example, when a child is born, that child has all the neurons it will ever have in its life. Neurons are the primary components of the brain and nervous system – they are the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the outside world, for sending motor commands to our brain, and transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every phase of development in-between. Moreover, the last moments of these neural connections, when they finally set will define who we are as people.

                           Think of the neurons in a brain as being wires in a home instead. If certain wiring is not connected, appliances won’t work. Lights won’t turn on. The worst scenario of bad wiring would be zero electric power in the home at all – leaving everywhere in the home dark and scary. A candle can help, but it cannot fix or get rid of the problem altogether. The wiring has to be repaired so that the electric in the household can work correctly. Similarly, research has shown that if a baby is not touched by loving hands or gentle voices on a regular basis (not relaying the needed electrical signals for their brain to develop properly), then certain wiring in their brain simply cannot and will not connect. Furthermore, and adding to the urgency of connecting these wires properly early on; a baby’s brain doubles in size in the first year. Consequently, good and (unfortunately) bad experiences in a child’s first years will vastly be responsible for guiding the direction of how their brain will develop; these are the actual structural foundations of who that baby will be and how they will survive in the future.

                         An electrician, who can rewire or replace inoperable wiring, is able to fix damaged electrical wiring in a home. A baby only has the neurons they were born with and if they are left damaged or improperly connected; it is only natural that certain parts of their brain will be left in the dark or undeveloped. Remember, these neurons help mature the skills, emotions and character of a person; the disconnections of a person’s wiring greatly explains why humans have certain issues in adulthood. Now we can understand that it is reasonable to say that once the neurons in a young child are set at around the age of 5 years old, they cannot be transformed or rewired any other way. After that, their brains will only have 10% left to develop before adulthood. Therapy can take the place of a candle maybe, but if we have these facts, we can do our best to avoid unnecessary pain for our kids in their future lives. It is well known that hurt people hurt other people; but if we can help eradicate this harmful cycle, we can make room for more love in this world.

                           We no longer have to wonder why certain people act certain ways (apart from inherited health, genetics or their environments). Consequently, with this awareness at hand, if a person is in an abusive situation with another person, they need to consider making the difficult (and yes, it is difficult) choice to leave at the first sign of attempts of isolation or verbal and physical abuse, etc. This can also be true with friends, contacts and associates at work as well romantic relationships. Thinking that person will change or attempting to change that person while believing their apologies will be real just cannot qualify as a true recovery because now we know their brain has been set as a result of their bad experiences as a young child. Bringing new children into this unsafe environment only creates more pain and adds to a loveless world. It promotes the cycle of abuse instead eliminating it. Also, recognize that lot of these people can fake it and it will not be real; the crazy in them will most likely rear its ugly head sooner than later, and that is why their cycle of mistreatment of others will no doubt happen over and over again. However, if we can understand the future harmful results of our manipulated (by another) choices, we can now use this awareness to give us the strength to make the correct choices with confidence and without wondering, what if? Because now know, what if!

                           Whatever the case may be and if we are stuck in inescapable situations, we can still help our children. The more a young child reads, listens to stories or music, or takes part in fun and motivating activities during their early years, the stronger and healthier that child’s brain will develop during any kind of journey into adulthood. It begins with babies, so parents must start right away by nurturing them with loving care and motivating activities to empower their development. One parent can achieve this for their children, even if the other parent does not have the foresight to do so. Adults who are prone to arguing, yelling or who are negatively demonstrative must do their best to take it to a different room. “Not in front of the baby/children,” is a rule that must be kept if young children are to be protected and saved from the hazards of harmful experiences. You can be the one to shield those precious neurons and keep them on the right path of development. We must be able to manage this for our children at least up to the age of 5- 7 years old because child experts have warned us what will happen to our children if we do not keep this guidance.

They need to be recognized for their early achievements as much as possible. This will assist them to be able to manage long lasting relationships later on in life.

                           Spending a solid, enriching 20 minutes on The Rainbow Race activities one-on-one with a young child is far more valuable than sitting with them; watching 4 hours of TV every day. This minimal time spent with a young child will at the least help them to manage their emotions and recognize wrong choices. Nowadays adults can be very busy and as mentioned earlier, we all know that time goes by so quickly. This time can never be gotten back. The Rainbow Race can counteract this lack of time in our busy world. Just 20 minutes a day can do wonders to override or negate the effects of bad experiences for a young child in a most efficient and loving way. The Rainbow Race has discussion pages where an adult and a child can have discussions on a myriad of subjects that will inspire them to stay positive under most situations.
