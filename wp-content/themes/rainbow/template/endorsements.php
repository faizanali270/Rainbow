                                    “Character education is critical for toddlers, pre k and elementary age school children. It provides a blueprint for them to develop into the people that they will become. A child’s brain develops from when they are born to around 5-7 years old. Therefore, whatever negative experiences they may go through during this important time will set and be difficult to change after the age of 7 years old. A parent must closely observe their child during this time in order to work through any problems that may arise. Unfortunately, some parents do not get the time to do this. This could explain why some adults unintentionally stray down the wrong path and find it difficult to change. Subsequently, the more attention and positive inputs a very young child can experience, the better chance they will have to become an emotionally and mentally effective adult. The 7 stories in “The Rainbow Race” are a welcome addition to support a happy life. These meaningful books are captivating and will keep young children interested while instilling positive as well as extremely important messages. Listening to or reading all of the 7 creative books in “The Rainbow Race” in order to receive its consequent “Certificate of Completion” will inspire invaluable awareness in young people which in turn will empower them to develop the strong character they need to become successful adults.”

                                 “The Rainbow Race” is a wonderful way to spread awareness among young children in order for them to rise above the challenges in their lives. In today’s world, young children become familiar with adult ways and issues far too early in life. These positive story books help them to counteract the negative times they may experience by showing them that they can choose to be happy and in-control under almost all circumstances. The FREE songs and games are fun and entertaining and with the added incentive of their potential to empower young children, they are a priceless addition to the healthy mental and emotional growth of a child. “The Rainbow Race” is also an effective way for parents to be involved in their child’s life. A parent can spend a quality hour with their child that will be memorable to both with the interesting “Discussion Pages.” Instilling these messages in a young child will have a strong impact on them and will most definitely help them to become successful adults. We support “The Rainbow Race” as being the most creative way to encourage young children to choose to be positive no matter what they may face in life. I can honestly say, from my many years of experience with children, that all 7 BOOKS of “The Rainbow Race” are a MUST buy for every household with children under 7 years old!”

                                     The stories and songs in The Rainbow Race are a great way to teach young children how to handle real life situations with responsibility and accountability. The Rainbow Race can help a child avoid troubles in adulthood that result from them going through difficult times at a young age. Parents can spend time with a child that will be memorable to both. A child who is taught how to overcome negative emotions by choosing positive ones instead has a much better chance of leading a mentally and emotionally successful life.

In addition to their upbeat energy, they include essential and very important messages, which make “The Rainbow Race” an awesome experience for every parent and child. Our team has over 20 years of experience in childcare and in that time we have not seen a more simple, but powerful way to instill positive behavior into young children! The added music versions are up to date and with the opportunity of building confidence into a child by learning to perform with singing these fun stories will no doubt give a child memorable entertainment while teaching them that they can choose to be successful on top. A child can be entertained for hours. We love the idea of a child receiving a certificate at the end of “The Rainbow Race.” We believe words of affirmation work to bring a person success and we support this theory. What more could a parent want? With teachings that will last a lifetime, all 7 stories of “The Rainbow Race,” collectively get our vote for the most entertaining and positive gift anyone can buy a child!”                            </h4>

                                 “The Rainbow Race” is not only a great way to spread much needed awareness among young children, it will also remind parents to be aware that children before the age of 5-7 are more apt to be affected and even damaged mentally and emotionally by the negative behaviors they see and experience in their homes and at school. These experiences can and have been confirmed to stay with them into adulthood, negatively affecting their relationships especially the close ones. I have worked with young children (in therapy and psychologically) for over 25 years and I can confirm that it is very difficult for a child to change negative behaviors after reaching this age.”

                                As a Child Custody Evaluator for the Los Angeles Supreme Courts for over 12 years, I have personally experienced the effects children face as a result of separation, divorce, blended families and child custody visitation. In my process of evaluating these children, I have looked into different books to help them. I have not found anything that targets their feelings in such a creative way. I am very impressed with “The Rainbow Race” because the stories will connect directly to the true feelings of these young children. Reading these stories and turning it into a relay race will undoubtedly bring children the knowledge and power they need to endure and overcome most of the uncomfortable obstacles that may come their way. The added Certificate of Completion will help them to learn to finish what they begin. The Rainbow Race” will help young children to become successful adults by encouraging them to choose to react positively instead of negatively no matter what they may face in life… “The Rainbow Race” is a well written and much needed tool to empower children in this day and age! I recommend every parent to invest in this, while learning something for themselves along the way!”
